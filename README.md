# materialandtheirpricecalculator
I have coded a calculator which takes dimensions of wall as input and then calculates the material which will be used for constructing that wall and also calculates the material and price that is going to cost for that material. all the analysis is going to be done on the basis of data provided manually to code about prices which is for now manual.
